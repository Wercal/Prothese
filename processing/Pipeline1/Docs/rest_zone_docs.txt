Rest zones : 

	Definition : 

		Period where the data sent from the all 8 emg sensors is a "flat line"
		(no active signal). 

		There are no rest zones during a movement. 

		Rest zones can surround a period where the sensors record movement. A rest zone
		before and/or after the movement period. 


		The start of a rest zone can mark the ending of a movement.
		The end of a rest zone cam mark the beginning of a movement.



	Removing rest zones from data :

		A buffer of n data slots (20 by default) is slid across the 50 input points. 
		
		As the buffer moves (1->2 and 20->21) a rms is calculated with all of the buffers
		members. If the rms value for the buffer members is under a certain value/thresh "k"
		(currently k=4) the buffer marks a rest zone. 
		  

	Result of removing rest zones : 

		Once rest zones are removed from data, the data is turned into an "ActiveData"
		instance. 

		Active data instances deail if the data contained a rest zone and isolates : 

			data before the first rest zone
			after the last rest zone
