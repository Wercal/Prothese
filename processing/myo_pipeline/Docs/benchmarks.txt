		** for the following benchmarks, all print-outs were commented from the code, for
		   maximum effiency.

		- Raw data buffer (in "maintain_pipeline_buffer" function) :

			- Buffer fill time (avg for 50 segments) = 0.125 seconds
			- Buffer fill frequency = 8 Hz

		- Pipeline buffer (in ) : 

			With active hand movement : 

				- Buffer fill time (avg for 50 fills) = 0.1253
				- Buffer fill frequency = 7.98
