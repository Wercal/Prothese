Maintain pipeline buffer : 

	- launches the myo data acquisition process which fills the raw data buffer

	- pulls from the raw data buffer and creates Active data instances (check "rest_zone_docs")

	- Active data instances are put in a queue (fifo), and are used to fill the pipeline buffer
	* it may take more than on active data instance to fill the pipeline buffer. 

	- when the pipeline data is filled with "active data", a flag (buffer_ready) is flipped via	       redis db to let the main program that new data is available.

	- the buffer maintenance loop runs until a problem occurs in the data acquisition sub
	  process.
